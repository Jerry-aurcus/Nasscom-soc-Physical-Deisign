### How to Talk to Computers

### 1. Introduction to QFN-48 Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs

Most of us have encountered an Arduino board at some point (as shown below). It is a microcontroller-based development platform that simplifies the creation of electronic projects. The board integrates a programmable chip (highlighted in the encircled area) with a PCB, input/output pins, a USB interface, power regulators, and various supporting components. In this project, we will explore how to design such a microprocessor chip—starting from modeling its specifications using the C language, developing its RTL (in Verilog/VHDL), and finally generating the layout in GDSII file format, which is sent to the foundry.
